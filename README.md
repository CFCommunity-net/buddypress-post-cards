# BuddyPress Post cards
*This plugin is made for CFCommunity.net - A Social Network for people affected by Cystic Fibrosis.*

BuddyPress Post cards Makes it easy for your members to sent real physical post cards to each other. Similar to sending a private message but more personal. 

## Requirements
- BuddyPress 2+
- A Lob.com API Key

### Features
- Post card Covers: upload a custom post card cover or select from a standard library of post card covers
- Message: A user can add a custom message to the card
- International: Post cards are delivered internationally 

### So how does it work?

A new button is added to a users profile *Send a Postcard*. This is similar to the "Private Message" or "Public Mention" button.

When a user clicks on this button they get taken to a wizard which is similar to the Group Creation process. It all starts with uploading a photo. 

*note: It would be awesome to have a library of default cards. Similar to Matthieu his BP Avatar suggestion plugin (https://wordpress.org/plugins/bp-avatar-suggestions/)

After uploading and cropping an image the user writes a custom message.

On the next screen the user sees a preview of the card and needs to confirm his/her own address (currently missing from the mock-up)

On the final step the users gets a confirmation that the post card was successfully sent!
